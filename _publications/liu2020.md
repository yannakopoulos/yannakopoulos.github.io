title: "Supervised learning is an accurate method for network-based gene classification"

excerpt: 'Assigning every human gene to specific functions, diseases, and traits is a grand challenge in modern genetics. Key to addressing this challenge are computational methods such as supervised-learning and label-propagation that can leverage molecular interaction networks to predict gene attributes. In spite of being a popular machine learning technique across fields, supervised-learning has been applied only in a few network-based studies for predicting pathway-, phenotype-, or disease-associated genes. It is unknown how supervised-learning broadly performs across different networks and diverse gene classification tasks, and how it compares to label-propagation, the widely-benchmarked canonical approach for this problem.'
