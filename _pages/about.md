I am a PhD student in the department of [Computational Math, Science, & Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). I work in the [Krishnan Lab](https://www.thekrishnanlab.org) on applying natural language processing and weighted, semi-supervised machine learning to the study of human genomics. My interests also include high-performance computing and promoting accessible education in technology and computer science.
