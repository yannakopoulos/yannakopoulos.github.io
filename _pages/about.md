I am a PhD student in the department of [Computational Math, Science, & Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University. I work in [the Krishnan Lab](https://www.thekrishnanlab.org) on weighted machine learning and natural language processing applied to human genomics.

I love to read, kayak, and code!
